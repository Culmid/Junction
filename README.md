## Description

This project is an example eCommerce website that is build from a Figma Design. The idea of this project is to build the basic functionality of an eCommerce website using vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. This project is primarily a desktop centered project, however mobile support could/may be added.

## Implementation

Currently the project is a two page website, with a Home Page and a Single Product Page. The Home Page is generated automatically my script.js. Whereas, the Single Product Page is static (for the time being). Both pages are currently not very dynamic pages (minus CSS effects and the Show More button on the Home Page), but more functionality is to be added in the near future.
